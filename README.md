# Genetic_NQueen_TSP
Implement a genetic algorithm capable of solving discrete and continuous problems. Solve the following issues with your algorithm. Report the process of improving the values of the objective function in the following diagrams.
a)NQueen for n from 8 to 50
b)TSP with 10 to 25 node
c)Peak function maximization problem when x and y is between 10 and -10
z = 3*(1-x).^2.*exp(-(x.^2) - (y+1).^2)- 10*(x/5 - x.^3 - y.^5).*exp(-x.^2-y.^2)- 1/3*exp(-(x+1).^2 - y.^2)
